# sxsexp Expand compressed files from WinSxS folder.
build of https://github.com/hfiref0x/SXSEXP - which should be the same as 'SxSExpand.exe' https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/aunty-mels-cheap-and-nasty-sxs-file-expander-updated-2013-09-29.48613/ - extracts sxs [DCN,DCM,DCS,DCD], their basic syntax is the same, but 'SxSExpand.exe' also allows command line to specify the packing..
